## Overview
A Python program that simulates various **binary logic gates** (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR). Users can input binary values and select logic gates to perform operations. The program supports input validation and repeated usage.

## Features
- Interactive CLI interface with a user-friendly banner.
- Supports the following logic gates:
  - AND
  - OR
  - NAND
  - NOR
  - XOR
  - XNOR
- Input validation for binary numbers (0 or 1).
- Retake inputs and try different operations with ease.

## Usage
1. Run the program in any Python interpreter.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Input binary values (0 or 1) for `a` and `b`.  
4. Choose from the available gates to see the output.
5. You can rerun the operations with new inputs or retry different gates.

## Example
```
enter your name: John

========================================
            input a: 1
========================================
            input b: 0
========================================

Available LOGIC gates:
1. AND-gate
2. OR-gate
3. NAND-gate
4. NOR-gate
5. XOR-gate
6. XNOR-gate

enter your choice to perform the binary operation: 1
The operation of AND GATE with the two inputs 1 and 0 is False
========================================
Do you want to try another gate? (yes/no): no
========================================
To try another boolean operation with different values, input yes, and to exit the code enter no (yes/no): no
========================================
see you again, John
```
